This directory is for the ros node called 
'turtlebot_tele_presence'.

This node is to be written in python for the ros Robot Operating
System specifically for the turtlebot telepresence robot project.

The development environment for this project is Ubuntu LTS 12.04. 
ROS Hydro was installed on the development machines. The environment 
for the telepresence robot itself was ROS Groovy on an Ubuntu base 
system.

Installation of the ROS system is left to the reader. The link to 
the ROS documentation for installation is:
